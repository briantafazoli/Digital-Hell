## Welcome to Digital Hell!!!

This is a multiband bitcrusher plugin created by Brian Tafazoli. This plugin was originally built as a final project for a class, but I've since expanded on it and would like to release it to the public. 

## Installing the Plugin

Currently, this plugin is only available in VST3 and exe format. To download it for usage in your DAW, download the file named "BrianT-PFinal-DigitalHell.vst3". Drag the file into the folder your DAW scans for VST3 presets. After that, your plugin should be good to go!

To access the standalone plugin, download "BrianT-PFinal-DigitalHell.exe".

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the plugin, contact me at brian.tafazoli@gmail.com.
