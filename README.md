## Welcome to Digital Hell!!!

This is a multiband bitcrusher plugin created by Brian Tafazoli. This plugin was originally built as a final project for a class, but I've since expanded on it and would like to release it to the public. 

## Installing the Plugin

Currently, this plugin is only available in VST3 format and Windows 10+ for 64-bit platforms. The MacOS version should be coming soon. 

This code contains the full source and is completely free, as laid out in AGPLv3 licensing with JUCE 8. 

To download it for usage in your DAW, download the file named "BrianT-PFinal-DigitalHell.vst3". Drag the file into the folder your DAW scans for VST3 presets. This will probably be a folder like C:/Program Files/Common Files/VST3, but you should be able to check it in your DAW.
After that, your plugin should be good to go!

PATCH NOTES:

Version 1.1 is out! 
I've changed the method for selecting the frequency bands with a brand new, two headed slider. 
The red diamond is used to control the cutoff between the LOW and MID bands, such that everything to the left of the slider falls under the control of the LOW band. 
The blue diamond is used to control the cutoff between the MID and HIGH bands, such that everything to the right of the slider falls under the control of the HIGH band.
The area in between the red and blue diamonds represents the MID band.
